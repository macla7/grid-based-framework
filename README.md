An TOP <a href='https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/html-and-css/lessons/using-css-preprocessors-to-save-time'>project</a>.

Just made a very simple 12 or 16 column container grid framework.

The framwork is a SCSS partial that's then complied into the top of the main_style.scss before it is preprossed into the main_style.css file a folder above.

Used some SCSS loops and mixins to steamline this grid making, which I think was actually not a totally arbitrary use case.

Peace and love ✌️ 🕊
